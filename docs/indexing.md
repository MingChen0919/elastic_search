# What is Indexing?
Think of indices as a structured data store that allows Elasticsearch to perform fast searching. This store is also how
Elasticsearch becomes aware of your site's content.

For details about indexing operations, please visit [Elasticsearch's documentation (What is an Elasticsearch Index?)](https://www.elastic.co/blog/what-is-an-elasticsearch-index)
